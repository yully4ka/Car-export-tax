# Car-export-tax
The calculator shows the payed tax and the potential refund for exported car.

When a car is exported from Norway, the owner is entitled for one-time tax refund.
This calculator shows the one-time tax which was payed upon registration, and the potential refund, based on the date the car is planned to be exported. It is based on the Skatteetaten calculator https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/duties/cars-and-other-vehicles/export/calculate/, but is using only cars details, without knowing the registration number of the car.
